# Ablation: Prioritized Experience Replay (Schaul et al., 2016)
# Tests the impact of prioritized sampling using model loss as priority signal.
#
# DreamerV3 uses uniform replay by default. This ablation enables
# prioritized sampling (50/50 mix with uniform) with IS weight correction.
# Use fracs.priority to control prioritization strength.

prioritized_replay:
  replay:
    fracs: {uniform: 0.5, priority: 0.5, recency: 0.0}

      is_correction: True  # Enable IS weight correction (β annealing)
      beta0: 0.4           # Initial β (annealed to 1.0)
      beta_frames: 1e7     # Steps to anneal β to 1.0

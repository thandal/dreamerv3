# Gaussian Latent Representation Experiment
# Replace categorical (one-hot) latent variables with Gaussian latents.
# This tests whether continuous latent representations work better than discrete.
#
# Reference: Original RSSM (Hafner et al., 2019) used Gaussian latents
#
# Technical notes:
# - Gaussian latents use shape (stoch,) instead of (stoch, classes)
# - Network outputs stoch * 2 parameters: mean and log_stddev
# - Standard deviation is clipped to [0.1, 1.0] by default
# - KL divergence is computed analytically for Gaussians

        # and 'stoch' determines the dimensionality of the Gaussian
